 
# Twelve Days of Christmas CLI tool in Rust
Done as part of practicing the [3.5 Control Flow section of the official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html) which has users to try to build certain programs to practice what they learned.

This program can be used via CLI. It prints the full lyrics of "A Song And A Christmas Tree (The Twelve Days of Christmas) by Andy Williams" taking advantage of the lyrical repetitions in the song.

## Playground  

This project is meant as a playground to practice the Rust programming language while following the official documentation.
The author has no previous experience with Rust and this has been developed with knowledge acquired in Rust by following up until the [3.5 Control Flow section of the official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html). 
If further concepts that may improve this program at later chapters are learned, this program will not be refactored to use the new concepts, but rather new programs will be built.
Please consider this when reviewing the code.
